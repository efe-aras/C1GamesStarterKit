On the other hand, the **universal approximation theorem** tells us that we can approximate any continuous function using a sufficiently large neural network, if we use nonlinear activation functions. It's worth emphasizing that the theory of the UAT and what networks look like in practice are very different - in particular, many versions of the UAT are based on a shallow but extremely wide neural network, on the other hand most of the power of modern neural networks comes from their ability to compose between layers: feeding the output of one layer into the input of another, and create increasingly expressive functions.

We define a transform for the MNIST data (which is applied to each image in the dataset) by composing `ToTensor` (which converts a `PIL.Image` object into a PyTorch tensor) and `Normalize` (which takes arguments for the mean and standard deviation, and performs the linear transformation `x -> (x - mean) / std`). For the latter, we use `0.1307` and `0.3081` which are the empirical mean & std of the raw data (so after this transformation, the data will have mean 0 and variance 1).\n",

The first argument tells us where to save our data to (so that when we run this in the future we won't have to re-save it), and `transform=MNIST_TRANSFORM` tells us that we should apply our previously defined `transform` to each element in our dataset. We also use `Subset` which allows us to return a slice of the dataset rather than the whole thing (because our model won't need much data to train!).\n",

The code above demonstrates iteration over the dataset & dataloader respectively, showing how the first element in the dataloader's first batch equals the first element in the dataset (note that this wouldn't be true for the training set, because we've shuffled it).\n",

Dataclasses are a special kind of class which come with built-in methods for initialising and printing (i.e. no need to define an `__init__` or `__repr__`). Another advantage of using them is autocompletion: when you type in `args.` in VSCode, you'll get a dropdown of all your different dataclass attributes, which can be useful when you've forgotten what you called a variable!\n",

        "A convolution is an operation which takes a kernel and slides it across the input, applying the kernel to each patch of the input. We can view it as a logical extension of the linear layer, except rather than having every output value being determined as a linear combination of every input value, we have a **prior of locality** - assuming that the input has some spatial structure, and each output value should only be determined by a small patch of the input. The kernel contains our learned weights, and we slide that kernel across our input, with each output value being computed by a sumproduct of the kernel values and the corresponding patch in the input. Note that we use all input channels when computing each output value, which means the sumproduct is over `kernel_length * in_channels` elements (or `kernel_width * kernel_height * in_channels` when, as is most often the case, we're using 2D kernels)."

If this is true then we do set the right branch to be the identity (that's what the \"OPTIONAL\" annotation refers to), but if this isn't true then we set the right branch to be a 1x1 convolution with stride `first_stride`, zero padding, and mapping from `in_feats` to `out_feats`, followed by a batchnorm layer.

        "To test your implementation, you can use the helper function `print_param_count` which prints out a stylized dataframe comparing your model's parameter count to the PyTorch implementation. Alternatively, you can use the following code to import your own `resnet34`, and inspect its architecture:\n",

        "```python\n",
        "resnet = models.resnet34()\n",

        "Both will give you the shape & size of each of your model's parameters & buffers, and code is provided for both of these methods below.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note - in order to copy weights from the reference model to your implementation (which we'll do after this exercise), you'll need to have all the parameters defined in the same order as they are in the reference model - in other words, the rows from the two halves of the dataframe created via `print_param_count` should perfectly match up with each other. This can be a bit fiddly to get right, especially if the names of your parameters are different to the names in the PyTorch implementation. We recommend you look at the `__init__` methods of the solution if you're stuck (since it's the order that things are defined in for the various ResNet modules which determines the order of the rows in the dataframe).\n",
        "\n",
        "This 1-to-1 weight comparison won't always be possible during model replications, for example when we replicate GPT2-Small next week we'll be defining the attention weight matrices differently (in a way that's more condusive to interpretability research). In these cases, you'll need to resort to different debugging methods, like running the models on the same input and checking they give the same output. You can also break this down into smaller steps by running individual models, and by checking the shape before checking values. However in this case we don't need to resort to that, because our implementation is equivalent to the reference model's implementation.\n",
        "\n",
        "As a more general point, tweaking your model until all the layers match up might be a difficult and frustrating exercise at times, however it's a pretty good example of the kind of low-level model implementation and debugging that is important for your growth as ML engineers! So don't be disheartened if you find it hard to get exactly right (although we certainly recommend looking at the solutions and moving on if you're stuck on this particular exercise for more than ~45 minutes)."

But the parameter from the PyTorch model has shape `(128, 64, 3, 3)`, i.e. it's a convolutional weight with a 3x3 kernel, so must be from the left branch (it also matches the naming convention for the left-branch convolutional weight from the first blockgroup - row index 3 in the dataframe). So we've now figured out what the problem is: **your implementation defines the right branch before the left branch in the the `ResidualBlock.__init__` method, and to match param orders with the PyTorch model you should swap them around.**\n",

If a parameter has its `requires_grad` attribute set to `False`, it means gradients won't be computed for this tensor during backpropagation.

I see this as analogous to how [many CS courses](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/) start by teaching you about languages like C and concepts like pointers and memory management before moving on to higher-level langauges like Python which abstract away these details. The hope is that when you get to the later sections of the course, you'll have the tools to understand them better."

        "Firstly, some explanation of `conv1d` in PyTorch. The `1` in `1d` here refers to the number of dimensions along which we slide the weights (also called the kernel) when we convolve. Importantly, it does not refer to the number of dimensions of the tensors that are being used in our calculations. Typically the input and kernel are both 3D:\n",

        "* For each possible position of the kernel inside the model (i.e. each freezeframe position in the sketch), the operation happening is as follows:\n",
        "    * We take the product of the kernel values with the corresponding input values, and then take the sum\n",
        "    * This gives us a single value for each output channel\n",
        "    * These values are then passed into the output tensor\n",

Commonly, powers of 2 are chosen for computational efficiency, and deeper layers might have more channels to capture complex features. Additionally, this parameter is sometimes chosen based on the heuristic of wanting to balance the parameter count / compute for each layer - which is why you often see `out_channels` growing as the size of each feature map gets smaller."
